# AMK-Renderer
Basic 3D software renderer written in pure C++

the goal of this project was to do everything from scratch
without using any external 3rd-party graphics libraries.

Features :
- basic 3D Rendering pipeline.
- UV, Texture and Normals mapping.
- specular highlighting.
- limited support for loading ".obj" file format :
  - the program uses custom commands written to ".obj files" to specify textures and other things.
  - the program can only process "Tri" and "Quad" faces, no support for "multi-vertex" faces.
- saving the render to an image.
